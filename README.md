## Typescript Starter for Web Development

My core intent for creating this project was to have a quick offline playground akin to Stackblitz but without having the need for being online.

I often found that I wanted to quickly spin-up a Web development environment to try something out. Most days I would turn to Stackblitz for this. However, there are days when you don't want to, or can't, go online.

This project was created just for those days.

## Not Production Ready

This is not meant to be a Production-ready environment, but rather a local developer sandbox; a blank-slate if you will to quickly get you up and running build some web-concepts.
